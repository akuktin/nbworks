This is nbworks-0.7.0. This is a DEVELOPMENT release.

While this is a development release, it is stable and should behave well in a
sane environment. The primary purpose of releasing it then is to let the mob
descend upon the code and find all the creative and unusual ways the code
breaks when abused. It is in no way guarranteed that such breakes will happen.
If any are found, these breakages will then be fixed and, when they are all
addressed, the code will be released as a stable release.
