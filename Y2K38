This is a possibly partial and incomplete list of the things that will happen
as all signed 32-bit time_t type counters overflow on 2038-01-19 03:14:07 UTC.

Nbworks handles time_t in a type-agnostic way. For this reason, it is possible
to increase time_t transparently to the source code.

Any points in the code that should have special attention drawn to them are
marked with "Y2K38".


The List:

caretaker sends like crazy
name refresher sends like crazy
send and receive will have their timeouts become ineffectual over the overflow
fragments will become stuck over the overflow
old scopes will become stuck over the overflow
before the overflow names are not deleted if their deathtimes are INFINITY
after the overflow, no old names are deleted
no new servers will be installed in the last second
old queuestorages in the service sector will become stuck over the overflow
names whose deathtimes are updated will have their deathtimes stuck in INFINITY
names are not defended during the last second
names are not used for answering queries during the last second
name conflicts are not taken into account during the last second
