To install, first checkout the Makefile and see if all the installation paths
relative to $(PREFIX) are okay. Then, build with:

    make

Once `make' finishes, decide on a installation prefix and install with:

    make PREFIX=/what/ever/ install

The default prefix is `/usr/local'.


***************************

Currently, there is a problem when compling with at least GCC of at least
version 4.4.6. Namely, when ANY sort of optimization is used (-O1, -O2, -O3 or
-Os), GCC just completely drops the ball and turns the busywait locks that are
used to prevent use-after-frees into inescapable infinite loops. So, don't use
optimization if you redefine $CFLAGS untill this problem gets worked out.
