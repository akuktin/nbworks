To install, first checkout the Makefile and see if all the installation paths
relative to $(PREFIX) are okay. Then, build with:

    make

Once `make' finishes, decide on a installation prefix and install with:

    make PREFIX=/what/ever/ install

The default prefix is `/usr/local'.

Gitorious users may want to check out the script do_CHECK_INTEGRITY.sh.
This script will verify the integrity of the sources. This is especially
important for Gitorious because, unlike Github, Gitorious generates a new
tarball everytime you download a release. Since these tarballs have different
timestamps on files, they have different checksums. It is therefore not
possible to just use a simple checksum verification.

Well, do_CHECK_INTEGRITY.sh skirts around this issue by doing all the hard
work itself and then finally just giving you two checksums for easy
verification.

Currently, there is a problem when compling with at least GCC of at least
version 4.4.6. Namely, when ANY sort of optimization is used (-O1, -O2, -O3 or
-Os), GCC just completely drops the ball and turns the busywait locks that are
used to prevent use-after-frees into inescapable infinite loops. So, don't use
optimization if you redefine $CFLAGS untill this problem gets worked out.
